Hey Jude don't make it bad, 
Take a sad song and make it better, 
Remember, to let her into your heart, 
Then you can start to make it better. 

Hey Jude don't be afraid, 
You were made to go out and get her, 
The minute you let her under your skin, 
Then you begin to make it better. 

And anytime you feel the pain, 
Hey Jude refrain, 
Don't carry the world upon your shoulders. 

For well you know that it's a fool, 
Who plays it cool, 
By making his world a little colder. 

Hey Jude don't let me down, 
You have found her now go and get her, 
Remember (Hey Jude) to let her into your heart, 
Then you can start to make it better. 

So let it out and let it in 
Hey Jude begin, 
You're waiting for someone to perform with. 

And don't you know that it's just you. 
Hey Jude, you'll do, 
The movement you need is on your shoulder. 

Hey Jude, don't make it bad, 
Take a sad song and make it better, 
Remember to let her under your skin, 
Then you'll begin to make it all better, better, better, better, 
better, better, better, ah! 
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na. 
Hey Jude, Jude , Jude, Jude, Jude, yeah, yeah! 

Words are flowing out like endless rain into a paper cup, 
They slither while they pass, they slip away across the universe. 
Pools of sorrow waves of joy are drifting through my opened mind, 
Possessing and caressing me. 

Jai guru deva om 
Nothing's gonna change my world 
Nothing's gonna change my world. 
Nothing's gonna change my world 
Nothing's gonna change my world. 

Images of broken light which dance before me like a million eyes, 
They call me on and on across the universe, 
Thoughts meander like a restless wind 
Inside a letter box they 
Tumble blindly as they make their way 
Across the universe 

Jai guru deva om 
Nothing's gonna change my world 
Nothing's gonna change my world. 
Nothing's gonna change my world 
Nothing's gonna change my world. 

Sounds of laughter shades of life are ringing 
Through my open ears inciting and inviting me. 
Limitless undying love which shines around me like a million suns, 
And calls me on and on across the universe 

Jai guru deva om 
Nothing's gonna change my world 
Nothing's gonna change my world. 
Nothing's gonna change my world 
Nothing's gonna change my world.

I find the things that you do, 
Will make me feel alright.

To get you money to buy you things, 
And it's worth it just to hear you say, 
You're gonna give me everything,

Cause when I get you alone, 
You know I feel okay.

When I'm home feeling you holding me 
Tight, tight, yeah.

Two of us riding nowhere
Spending someone's
Hard earned pay
You and me Sunday driving
Not arriving
On our way back home
We're on our way home
We're on our way home
We're going home

Two of us sending postcards
Writing letters
On my wall
You and me burning matches
Lifting latches
On our way back home
We're on our way home
We're on our way home
We're going home

You and I have memories
Longer than the road that stretches out ahead

Two of us wearing raincoats
Standing so low
In the sun
You and me chasing paper
Getting nowhere
On our way back home
We're on our way home
We're on our way home
We're going home

You and I have memories
Longer than the road that stretches out ahead

Two of us wearing raincoats
Standing so low
In the sun
You and me chasing paper
Getting nowhere
On our way back home
We're on our way home
We're on our way home
We're going home

I do a road hog
Well you can penetrate any place you go
Yes you can penetrate any place you go
I told you so, all I want is you
Everything has got to be just like you want it to
Because...

I pick a moon dog
Well you can radiate everything you are
Yes you can radiate everything you are

Oh now
I roll a stoney
Well you can imitate everyone you know
Yes you can imitate everyone you know
I told you so, all I want is you
Everything has got to be just like you want it to
Because...

Ooh now
I feel the wind blow
Well you can indicate everything you see
Yes you can indicate everything you see

Oh now
I dug a pony
Well you can syndicate any boat you row
Yeah you can syndicate any boat you row
I told you so, all I want is you
Everything has got to be just like you want it to
Because...

When I find myself in times of trouble
Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be
And in my hour of darkness
She is standing right in front of me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be
Let it be, let it be
Let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be

And when the broken hearted people
Living in the world agree
There will be an answer, let it be
For though they may be parted
There is still a chance that they will see
There will be an answer, let it be
Let it be, let it be
Let it be, let it be
Yeah there will be an answer, let it be
Let it be, let it be
Let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be

Let it be, let it be
Ah let it be, yeah let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be
And when the night is cloudy
There is still a light that shines on me
Shine on until tomorrow, let it be
I wake up to the sound of music,
Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be
Yeah let it be, let it be
Let it be, yeah let it be
Oh there will be an answer, let it be
Let it be, let it be
Let it be, yeah let it be
Oh there will be an answer, let it be
Let it be, let it be
Ah let it be, yeah let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be

Who looked like you

Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah

The long and winding road that leads to your door
Will never disappear
I've seen that road before it always leads me here
Leads me to your door

The wild and windy night that the rain washed away
Has left a pool of tears crying for the day
Why leave me standing here, let me know the way
Many times I've been alone and many times I've cried
Anyway you'll never know the many ways I've tried
And still they lead me back to the long and winding road
You left me standing here a long, long time ago
Don't leave me waiting here, lead me to you door

But still they lead me back to the long and winding road
You left me standing here a long, long time ago
Don't keep me waiting here, lead me to you door
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Something in the way she moves
Attracts me like no other lover
Something in the way she woos me

I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how

Somewhere in her smile she knows
That I don't need no other lover
Something in her style that shows me

Don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how

You're asking me will my love grow
I don't know, I don't know
You stick around now it may show
I don't know, I don't know

Something in the way she knows
And all I have to do is think of her
Something in the things she shows me

Don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how


My baby says she's trav'ling on the one after 909
I said move over honey I'm travelling on that line
I said move over once, move over twice
Come on baby don't be cold as ice
I said I'm trav'ling on the one after 909

I begged her not to go and I begged her on my bended knees
You're only fooling around, you're fooling around with me
I said move over once, move over twice
Come on baby don't be cold as ice
I said I'm trav'ling on the one after 909

I got my bag, run to the station
Railman says you've got the the wrong location
I got my bag, run right home
Then I find I've got the number wrong

Well I said I'm trav'ling on the one after 909
I said move over honey I'm travelling on that line
I said move over once, move over twice
Come on baby don't be cold as ice
I said I'm trav'ling on the one after 909

I got my bag, run to the station
railman says you've got the the wrong location
I got my bag, run right home
Then I find I've got the number wrong

Well I said I'm trav'ling on the one after 909
I said move over honey I'm travelling on that line
I said move over once, move over twice
Come on baby don't be cold as ice
I said we're trav'ling on the one after 90
I said we're trav'ling on the one after 90
I said we're trav'ling on the one after 909

Here comes the sun, here comes the sun
And I say it's all right

Little darling, it's been a long cold lonely winter
Little darling, it feels like years since it's been here

Here comes the sun, here comes the sun
And I say it's all right

Little darling, the smiles returning to the faces
Little darling, it seems like years since it's been here 

Here comes the sun, here comes the sun
And I say it's all right

Sun, sun, sun, here it comes
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes

Little darling, I feel that ice is slowly melting
Little darling, it seems like years since it's been clear

Here comes the sun, here comes the sun
And I say it's all right
Here comes the sun, here comes the sun
It's all right, it's all right
